### Hello, World! 👋 I'm Vittorio Halfon

**Digital Architect Specializing in Node.js and AI Solutions**

Welcome to my digital playground! Here's a quick tour:

**About Me**
🚀 I'm Vittorio, a self-taught dev with a knack for backend and GenAI. I speak more languages than some countries have in their national anthem - Italian, English, Spanish, and a hint of Hebrew.


**Tech Stack**
🛠️ My toolbox includes Node, Express, React, Python, Azure, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and more!


**Fun Facts**

🌍 Love to travel, especially if there's a good WiFi connection.

☕ Fueled by coffee and the tears of bug-fixing.
